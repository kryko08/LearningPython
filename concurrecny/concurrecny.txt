Introduction
-concurrent programming 
-asynchornous tasks run in single procces
-does not build on Threading or Multiprocessing

AsyncIO is based on cooperative multitasking 
tasks
-are able to operate separately from other tasks
-are able to wait for another task to return a result when required
-and are thus able to allow other tasks to run while they are waiting

The IO aspect
-suited to input outout tasks
-spends most of the time sending data to or reading data from some sort of external device
-program spends most of its time waiting for response from a external device
-asyncio allows to one task to wait for a response from the external device, meanwhile other tasks can be running 

Async event loop
-this loops controls how and when each task is run
-knows about each task and its state
-gives control to the task that is ready to run 
-tasks give up the processor when they decide to, they never get interrupted
